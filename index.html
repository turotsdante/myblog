I'm currently trying to prove to myself that I can do things and that I'm not a silly worthless dummy so I'm going to catalogue all my successes here so I can look back on them and go "yeah, see? A dead stick pretending to be a person couldn't achieve this! Remember, you're a person". I'm hoping one day I'll stop needing this page as a reminder and can just, know in my heart I'm good, but this is the first of many steps so here goes nothing hehe</div>
