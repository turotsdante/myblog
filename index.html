        <div id="preface-box">If you're reading this, hi! This is a personal website where I'm going to be posting just, stuff. Projects, coding, life things, stuff like that. I'm currently trying to prove to myself that I can do things and that I'm not a silly worthless dummy so I'm going to catalogue all my successes here so I can look back on them and go "yeah, see? A dead stick pretending to be a person couldn't achieve this! Remember, you're a person". I'm hoping one day I'll stop needing this page as a reminder and can just, know in my heart I'm good, but this is the first of many steps so here goes nothing hehe</div>

            <div class="text-blog-content">Normally I'd feel really weird putting out like, this much personal stuff out there, but I guess like, what the hell yunno? Anyways if someone's going to dislike me or think I'm weird for the things I've been going through then I think that says more about them than it says about me. So yeah, I'm going to say the things on my mind here. <br><br>It's therapy time babyyy! I think some people's life goals are to, well actually I don't know LOL. But whatever it is, it's probably not therapy. I was always scared of this because of familial reasons, but in hindsight I realise I gave my fears and anxiety more power than they should have. I don't blame myself for it, I know that in the past a lot happened and I tried a lot and got shut down a lot and so I don't fault myself for becoming so apprehensive of reaching out for the things I wanted in life, but I can't keep living like this, neglecting myself.<br><br>This makes me really really pissed, but like, I always knew this in my head, right? That I'm a person and deserve to push for the things that I want, that I deserve to be happy. But in my heart I didn't know this, I never felt like a person. What's worse is no one could reach me, I had to make this push myself. If it wasn't me doing it with my own hands, I don't think I could have accepted the outcome, because I had to prove to myself that I could do something with my own agency in this world. Now that I've finally convinced my family that I need a psychologist, okay this is going to sound weird, but for the first time I feel like a person. I don't know why exactly, I think it's because something I wanted and pushed for so long but got pushed off on for so long, was finally mine because of my own actions. Of course, others were pushing for this for me, but I was always scared of failing again. I did a lot of prep work, like mending my relationship with my parents first before asking, but in hindsight if I just pushed directly for therapy, things would have been much easier, but alas I was a massive coward, and still am. But it's getting better hehe~<br><br>I've already gone to the doctor and spoke about referrals and the financial plan to get things cheaper, what a relief. Booking tomorrow, hope the wait times aren't bad, the sooner the better. Oh, something that happened that was really weird. About a week ago I swore I'd stop self harming because in my head I knew it was self sabotage if I want to start feeling ok about myself, yk? Loving myself, treating myself gently and whatnot. I did succeed with this, even in times I really really really felt I needed it to feel ok, but I didn't. But then recently, I looked in my trash and saw the really bloody tissues from times in the past, and for the first time I thought to myself "Oh god... what the fuck have I done to myself??" and felt genuinely terrified????? I'm not used to this. It's like, normally I just felt right, like everything was ok, that I was hurting a sub-human monster that needed to be put in its place and be hurt. But like, this time, I thought "Oh god I hurt a person, I'm cutting a human, I'm a person". That was a really really scary moment. I don't think I can hurt myself anymore after that moment...<br><br>I say that but it hasn't been long since I felt that, so I don't want to jinx anything. I'm going to wait until it's been long enough that I can say that yeah, I've stopped. I guess that's why I'm even making this in the first place, so I have an easy place to come back and look on how far I've come, so I never feel like I'm not getting better. I know I'm getting better now that I'm focusing on myself, I know I want to get better. Just you wait life, I'm going to get back at you for this (with love &lt3)</div>
