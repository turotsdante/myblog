            Normally I'd feel really weird putting out like, this much personal stuff out there, but I guess like, what the hell yunno? Anyways if someone's going to dislike me or think I'm weird for the things I've been going through then I think that says more about them than it says about me. So yeah, I'm going to say the things on my mind here. (Edit: I added passwords to this so only the people closest to me can see, just in case)<br><br>
            It's therapy time babyyy! I think some people's life goals are to, well actually I don't know LOL. But whatever it is, it's probably not therapy. I was always scared of this because of familial reasons, but in hindsight I realise I gave my fears and anxiety more power than they should have. I don't blame myself for it, I know that in the past a lot happened and I tried a lot and got shut down a lot and so I don't fault myself for becoming so apprehensive of reaching out for the things I wanted in life, but I can't keep living like this, neglecting myself.<br><br>
            This makes me really really pissed, but like, I always knew this in my head, right? That I'm a person and deserve to push for the things that I want, that I deserve to be happy. But in my heart I didn't know this, I never felt like a person. What's worse is no one could reach me, I had to make this push myself. If it wasn't me doing it with my own hands, I don't think I could have accepted the outcome, because I had to prove to myself that I could do something with my own agency in this world. Now that I've finally convinced my family that I need a psychologist, okay this is going to sound weird, but for the first time I feel like a person. I don't know why exactly, I think it's because something I wanted and pushed for so long but got pushed off on for so long, was finally mine because of my own actions. Of course, others were pushing for this for me, but I was always scared of failing again. I did a lot of prep work, like mending my relationship with my parents first before asking, but in hindsight if I just pushed directly for therapy, things would have been much easier, but alas I was a massive coward, and still am. But it's getting better hehe~<br><br>
            I've already gone to the doctor and spoke about referrals and the financial plan to get things cheaper, what a relief. Booking tomorrow, hope the wait times aren't bad, the sooner the better. Oh, something that happened that was really weird. About a week ago I swore I'd stop self harming because in my head I knew it was self sabotage if I want to start feeling ok about myself, yk? Loving myself, treating myself gently and whatnot. I did succeed with this, even in times I really really really felt I needed it to feel ok, but I didn't. But then recently, I looked in my trash and saw the really bloody tissues from times in the past, and for the first time I thought to myself "Oh god... what the fuck have I done to myself??" and felt genuinely terrified????? I'm not used to this. It's like, normally I just felt right, like everything was ok, that I was hurting a sub-human monster that needed to be put in its place and be hurt. But like, this time, I thought "Oh god I hurt a person, I'm cutting a human, I'm a person". That was a really really scary moment. I don't think I can hurt myself anymore after that moment...<br><br>
            I say that but it hasn't been long since I felt that, so I don't want to jinx anything. I'm going to wait until it's been long enough that I can say that yeah, I've stopped. I guess that's why I'm even making this in the first place, so I have an easy place to come back and look on how far I've come, so I never feel like I'm not getting better. I know I'm getting better now that I'm focusing on myself, I know I want to get better. Just you wait life, I'm going to get back at you for this (with love &lt3)<br><br>
            What else what else, so... I've gone out a lot with friends. I always wanted to be invited in the past, because I felt like if people liked me they'd invite me out, if they didn't invite me it's because they don't like me. Fuck that, I deserve to ask for people's time if I wanna go out with people I'll ask for it god damnit, and I have been. And it's been, GREAT! And, I feel like, yeah, people don't hate me?? I even spoke with some strangers. Spoke to some guy who lives in singapore, talked about life stuff for an hour with them (I was with a friend too), it was great. I went to a CSESoc event. I was looking out for events myself and asked some friends to go with me, and there I met with some highschool people from the grade above and below and grabbed their discord contacts! Look at me go, me in first year would have never done that before.<br><br>
            I feel so stupid actually. I finally took the dive and all of a sudden life looks so good, even if I'm really scared. I feel so stupid because, I was 1 more push away. I know in the past, this would've been really far away. But I gave up trying because it hurt so much each time I did and got shut down. I gave my fears too much power, and I was a coward. I put up walls to protect myself from ever hoping I could be happy, but these walls just hurt everyone around me. Actually, I'll save my feelings for a seperate post. This can be about stuff I've done. I also picked up crochet! As shown by the crochet posts up top. I'm actually so proud of myself there, in only a few days I'm making super adorable pouches??? I have feelings on this too but they can wait for another post. OH I'VE BEEN READING TOO THAT'S BEEN FUN! I went to Chatswood library a couple days ago and found a wellness book for women. To all the girlies out there sorry but your wellness books are great and gender is a social construct so I'M STEALING YOUR BOOKS! Read through it, got called out IMMEDIATELY and just, yeah. It's actually been, quite eye opening some of what was in there, like learning to respond to my emotions instead of reacting to them, learning to rewrite my subconscious by interrupting my habits and taking a moment to think about why I feel that way, realising it's not my fault that I act subconsciously so awful because it's a behaviour I developed as a defence mechanism from hurt but that now I have the power to change it so that is my responsibility going forward, stuff like that.<br><br>
            It's weird in that I feel so much better about who I am as a person already, but I'm not going to claim that yet. It's been only about a week, I need more time. Time to feel comfortable and confident in my progress, that it's not just a spike of "I did something good for myself" which then quickly dips and leaves me with the same empty feeling as before. Again, it's why I'm writing up this blog and going to therapy. To know I'm long term ok. I'm going to worry about myself first in foremost. And also, one last thing is that I remembered what I told to Jen before we started dating. That I thought I would never date anyone because I hated myself and I would feel bad for anyone who got in a relationship with me and had to deal with someone so self loathing as me. That's changed. Not the loving myself enough part, that's a work in progress. But that I think I'll never date anyone part. I think in this arc of self worth (I learnt today from some reading that 'self worth' != 'self esteem') I'm learning to accept not in my head, but in my heart, that I can be loved. And that starts with me. And I want to be loved. I feel like my first relationship with Jen was an unfair go because I wasn't ready to love. I still love Jen so much though, I love her so god damn much that the fear of losing her eclipsed every fear I ever had of being hurt again when trying to love myself. I want to try again with Jen when we're both better, I want to be the one this time to ask for her to be the one with me for the rest of my life. I told her before I don't deserve to be in her life and she said that I do, but I think that really we both are the only ones who have a say, and I wasn't ready and in all my actions and words I said no. But I want to deserve to be in her life, I want to be by her side. One day, when I'm ready, I'll confess to her. Until then, I need to show love to someone who's even more important to me than Jen. Someone I've been neglecting all my life. You better get ready Marcus, I'm going to pry your eyes open to all the people who care for you and love you, and show you that among all of them, you will be the most salient and most important.

            <div class="text-blog-title">Feelings and shifts - 7 Oct 2024</div>
            <div class="text-blog-content">
            So, like I said, I'm making a separate blog post for how I've been feeling and thinking. So, wow. This is what normal people feel like? I say that but it's still too early to tell. But there are moments when I stop feeling paranoid about myself, or not stop but like, 70% less, which is huge? I've been trying to talk to myself in the mirror, compliment myself. That still feels strange, but now it feels different? In the past it felt really pathetic, now it feels, pathetic and hopeful?<br><br>
            Oh big one. When I did crocheting stuff, I felt something I didn't even consciously realise (but definitely unconsciously felt) I had forsake a long time ago, and that's just the feeling of going out and trying shit I find fun?? Like, I just watched youtube tutorials and made stuff and I felt proud of the outcome! That's crazy. I tried to remember when I last felt that and it made me realise, I gave up on this because losing piano hurt so much. Knowing that it'd never become a career for me, being told that by my parents a lot, knowing that hobbies at a high level can be a huge time cost, I just felt so awful. I never wanted to pick up things again knowing I'd lose them. It became a defence mechanism from the hurt I got from having to give up something I loved. I stopped trying thingis I thought were interesting. When I did crochet and just felt pride in what I had made, what I achieved, I felt incredible. I felt so empowered and amazing. I don't want to give up this feeling what the heck? So I'm going to be doing that. I want to draw, I want to code, I want to show off who I am to people and be praised for being amazing. That's who I've always really wanted to be, I know that, I just thought it was impossible and spent every ounce of energy beating that down. Not anymore though.<br><br>
            Speaking of, praise. I'm such a thirsty little goblin for praise aaaaaaaaaaaaaa. When people would compliment me or tell me I've been good or that I'm cute or funny or good company or a good listener, I'd gobble that shit up so bad, I felt starved. But I'd always shove it away too, because to accept it meant accepting there's a world where I'm actually happy. Not "content" happy, but truly really genuinely happy as myself for who I am. Each compliment felt like a taste of what I've always wanted but convinced myself I could never have. I developed a really toxic relationship where I felt the need to shut down compliments but always craved them. I want to accept compliments, I want to accept that people think I'm an amazing person, who's fun and cheery and who's happiness spreads around and infects others faster than yawns travel around a room of insomniacs. And I think this starts with me. I'm going to compliment myself more, remind myself how amazing of a person I am. Tell myself that people do enjoy my company. I want to go out more and talk to people and watch them enjoy talking to me, stop convincing myself that they're just pretending to care about what I'm saying, let myself accept that people like me. It starts with me.<br><br>
            Another thing is that lately after each success I've felt genuinely amazing. I want to tell the world I'm doing better, that I'm ready, but it would be too sudden to tell the world I'm a changed person now, and quite frankly it's not enough yet. It's like water and rocks. You can splash a rock with water and it becomes wet, but the water hasn't permeated into the rock's pores yet. I need time to absorb and digest these changes. Even if I feel amazing and ready to give everything another go, I realise that feeling ready means I'm finally 20% of the way to being ready. Healing is going to take time because it needs to soak in. I'm making this blog site for a few reasons. I want to feel accomplished, like if I use my own agency and abilities I can make something cool, something that makes me go "I did this. I'm incredible." I also want to have a place to write things down and access it easily. But I'm also making it so I can remind myself at a glance how far I'm coming. Remind myself each day that I'm amazing, that I'm worth it, so one day I no longer have to. It'll have permeated into my heart.<br><br>
            I don't know how long it's going to take for me to fix my subconscious. I hope my psychologist can help me with that, tell me the things that have hurt me and that it's alright, that I can do X Y Z things to fix it all. I want that certainty. I've been analysing myself for years now but nothing came of it, that whether I'm right or wrong doesn't matter anymore, I feel exhausted and lost in my deductions. I need a psychologist to tell me what's going on so I can feel confident. It has to be a professional. Non-professionals may care for me a lot, but they just don't know what exactly needs to be said to help me. Anyways, I'm going to keep trying my best. I'm going to keep the rock that is me wet for however long it takes for me to appreciate everything.

            <div class="text-blog-title">A little note - 7 Oct 2024</div>
            <div class="text-blog-content">
            Thanks youtube shorts again (I actually learn and see way too much helpful stuff in youtube shorts). A note to myself, I shouldn't be scared to be happy. I should just be happy. The more I fear being unhappy or failing to be happy the worse it gets. So I'm going to be happy, for me. Just a reminder for myself. That's all.
